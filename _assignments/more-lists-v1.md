# Assignment 2:  More Practice with Lists!
Collaboration on this assignment is required.

## Fun with Data

### Do this alone first
Write code that asks to the user to enter the names of their friends and family.  Tell them to enter a ‘Q’ to indicate they are done.  They should enter both first names and last names.  

Gather this data into a list.  Report back some statistics on the data:
Report back the first names given and a count of how many people had each name.
What was the most common first letter in the first names?
What was the most common last name, and how many people had that last name?  
What was the longest first name, the longest last name, and the longest overall name.
How many people had first names and last names that start with the same letter?

### Trade with someone else
Once you have this done, exchange solutions with someone else.  Take a look at how they solved the same problem.  Make notes for your readme file on what is similar and what is different.  Do a written “code review” for your partner, similar to what I have done for grading your assignments and give that feedback to them and include it in the files submitted to the dropbox.  

What to look for in the “code review”:

- Does the code work right?  Test different scenarios.  Do “bad” things, does it respond with error messages or does that “break” the program?  
- Did they use good names for variables?  Did they use global or script variables?  Are they used appropriately?  (Could you switch global variables to script variables, and vice versa?)
- Did they make blocks to handle different functionality?  Were those named well?  Did the inputs have good names and did they indicate the expected type?
- Is the overall code easy to read and understand.  Do you have questions on what was done or why it was done that way?  If you did something differently, discuss why one approach may be better or worse.

## Starting Materials
Start from scratch.  Find at least one other person to work with.  You will get “extras” credit if you code review more than one other person’s work.

## Submission Requirements
The following must be placed in the D2L dropbox:

### Project files

- Your Snap! code, name this file as HW3 with your first and last name, such as HW3_MaryMosman.xml.
- The other code that you reviewed.  Name this file as HW3_review with the other person’s first and last name, such as HW3_review_OtherPerson.xml.

### Review file
Write a text file with your feedback to your partner.  You can use screenshot and/or words to give feedback, but make sure to address all of the points mentioned above.

### Readme file
Write a file that has 2 sections:

- The first section, should describe what your program is and does.  Discuss how you solved the problems and any difficulties you ran into.

- The second section, Learning, should describe what you learned by reviewing the other person’s code.  Discuss the overall experience as well as what you learned, good or bad, from their code.  Did they do things differently?  Did you think that was better or worse?  How easy/hard was it to look at their code and figure out what it was doing?
