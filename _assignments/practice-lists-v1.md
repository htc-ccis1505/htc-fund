# Assignment 1:  Practice with Lists
Collaboration Policy: This assignment must be completed individually.  You may discuss high-level ideas with other students, but you should not share code.

## Average Grade
Write code that asks to enter a score (number from 0 to 100) or 'Q to end. Verify that the number entered is in the correct range or a 'Q'. If it is not, tell them about the problem and prompt for a new value.

If they did not enter 'Q', store the score in a list.  When they enter 'Q', then say the average of all the values entered, then tell them the letter grade that corresponds to that average score.

For example:

  Computer:  Enter a score from 0-100 or 'Q' to end.
  Person: 75
  Person: 110
  Computer: You must enter a number between 0-100.
  Person: 80
  Person: 85
  Person: Q
  Computer:  The average is 80. That is a B.

## Starting Materials
You have done a letter grade script in the past, but for the rest, start from scratch.


## Extras for Experts
Apply other types of averages to the list (there is mean, median, and mode) and determine the range.  


## Submission Requirements
The following must be placed in the D2L dropbox.  Add a comment if you completed the extra credit.


### Project file
This is the file with all your Snap! code.  Name this file as HW1 with your first and last name, such as:  HW1_MaryMosman.xml  


### Readme file
Write a file that has 2 sections:

- The first section, Summary, should describe what the program is and does.  If you’ve used new graphics or media and need to give credit for other’s work, this would be the place to do it.

- The second section, Learning, should describe what you found interesting and/or challenging (or not) about the assignment and how you worked through the challenges and solved the problem.  Perhaps you tried something and it didn’t work, then you tried a different approach.  Perhaps you didn’t know where to start and talked it through with a friend.  Perhaps the problem was easy because you’ve done something similar before.  The only “wrong” answer here is not to talk about how you solved the problem.
