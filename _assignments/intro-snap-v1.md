# Assignment 1:  Practice with Snap!

Collaboration Policy: This assignment must be completed individually.  You may discuss high-level ideas with other students, but you should not share code.

In lab, you worked on scripts to make the bug dance and draw flowers. Choose one of those scripts to expand on further for this assignment. Take some time to review and practice what you have learned while fancying it up.

## Requirements
Your updated script must be different than your final lab script and should:

- Start when the green flag is clicked.  Use the hat block to make this happen.
- Illustrate the use of custom blocks for composition
- Use custom blocks that take input to control behavior
- Make use of the random block
- Be well organized and easy to read (use good block and input names)

## Starting Materials
You should start from your Lab 2 Snap! script.  Choose either the bug-dance or field-of-flowers.

## Extras for Experts
Explore Snap!: Add a second sprite, a background, and/or different audio. Make sure you have rights to use any art, graphics or music you include.

## Submission Requirements
The following must be placed in the D2L dropbox.  Add a comment if you completed the extra credit.

### Project file
This is the file with all your Snap! code.  Name this file as HW1 with your first and last name, such as:  HW1_MaryMosman.xml  

### Readme file
Write a file that has 2 sections:

- The first section, Summary, should describe what the program is and does.  If you’ve used new graphics or media and need to give credit for other’s work, this would be the place to do it.

- The second section, Learning, should describe what you found challenging (or not) about the assignment and how you worked through the challenges and solved the problem.  Perhaps you tried something and it didn’t work, then you tried a different approach.  Perhaps you didn’t know where to start and talked it through with a friend.  Perhaps the problem was easy because you’ve done something similar before.  The only “wrong” answer here is not talk about how you solved the problem.
