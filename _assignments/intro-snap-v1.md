title: Practice with Snap!
name: intro-snap-v1
---

In lab, you worked on scripts to make the bug dance and draw flowers.  Choose one of those scripts to expand on further for this assignment.  Take some time to review and practice what you have learned while *fancying it up*.  

#### Requirements
Your updated script should :

- Illustrate the use of custom blocks for composition
- Use custom blocks that take input to control behavior
- Be well organized and easy to read (use good block and input names)

It **_must_** be different than your final lab script and **_your own work_**.  This should not be done as a pair, though you *may* use your paired lab work as a starting point.

A `README` file should accompany your script and describe the code that you wrote and the lessons that you learned. (If you're not sure what to say, use the lab handout questions for ideas.)  We will be posting this as part of your web portfolio site on GitHub, so you want it to look good and sound smart.  :sunglasses:
