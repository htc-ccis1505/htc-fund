We will be using [GitHub][github] to manage our projects.  This allows us to have a centralized location to store and manage the projects that we will create in this class.  It will also allow you to build a history of your work and show off a portfolio of the things that you can do.  

As we begin to work with python, you'll submit your project and get feedback using a *pull request*.  Understanding how to work with [GitHub](http://github.com/) and Git (the underlying version control system behind it) and are very important skills that can serve you long after completing this course.

#### Student Directory Assignment
To get started, you will introduce yourself to the class by adding an entry to the course's [Student Directory](https://github.com/htc-ccis1505/students). You will find instructions posted in the repository README file, which will be shown at the bottom of the main repository page.
