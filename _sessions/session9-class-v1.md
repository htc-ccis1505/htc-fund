title:  "Session 9: Algorithms (No class for WPO)"
name:   session9-class-v1

In this session, we are going to take a look at algorithms as we go through lab 6. We'll learn what an algorithm is, and then get a general sense of how to compare and choose between different algorithms.

If you're interested, feel free to try out lab 7 on your own.  It will not be required, but expands on the ideas in lab 6 and look in more depth at the performance of different algorithms.
