## Summary
Tonight we'll take some time to review what we've learned so far.  Then we'll discuss how these topics apply to computer programming and computer science. We'll focus the discussion around the concepts of abstraction and composition.

We'll follow up the lecture/discussion time with another lab and aim to have some time to work in class on the first project as well.
