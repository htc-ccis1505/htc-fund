## Summary
We'll begin with a quick overview of the course and introductions.  Working together will be a key component of the course, so be ready to be social and get to know one another.  For the first few classes, it will be required that you pair up with someone different each night.  

Once that is out of the way, we'll ensure that you are all set up with access to everything you need and then dive right into learning to code.  By the end of the night, you should have some pretty impressive stuff to show off.  In the next few weeks, we'll be putting together a simple web site to show off your work too.
