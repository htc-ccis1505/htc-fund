title:  "Session 7: More lists"
name:   session7-class-v1

Today will start by talking through one possible solution to Project 1.  Remember that there are multiple ways to solve programming problems, and just because *your* way is not the same as *my* way does not mean that it is incorrect or wrong.

We'll continue on working on another assignment to reinforce the work that we've been doing with lists.  As we discussed last week, lists are a really important topic in computer programming.  This is a really important concept to understand.  We'll be using lists a lot throughout the remainder of the course.
