## Summary
We'll focus on lab time tonight with the aim to have worked through all of Lab 2 & Lab 3 by the end of the evening.  

Before our next class you should have assignment 1 completed, and have a good start on project 1.  We will use some of the class time to discuss and work on the project, but it is likely you will not have time to finish if you have not already thought about and started on the problem before class.
