title: "Welcome to Fundamentals of Programming!"
---


<p>
This course is an introduction to computer programming. In this course, you'll learn to think like a programmer.  The focus of the course is on programming logic and structures - not learning a particular programming language.  We'll begin with a graphical language called Snap! and then transition into working with Python at the end of the course.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
There are a few things you need in order to be successful in this course:
    <ol>

        <li>A <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account.  Our course materials are hosted by GitHub, some of which may be private and require access to the <a href="https://github.com/htc-ccis1505">CCIS 1505 organization</a> to view.  Set yourself up with an account - I encourage you to use your actual name, then follow me (<a href="https://github.com/htcMosman">htcMosman</a>), and email me with both your real name and account name.  I will then add you to the course organization so that you can access our Gitter chat room and any private data.
        </li>

        <li>The <a href="www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> web browser.  It is recommended for working with Snap!.

        <li>A willingness to learn. This course can be challenging, but fun.  Persistence and a positive outlook go a long way.
        </li>

        <li>Teamwork.  We will regularly work in pairs in the classroom labs.  Make friends, have fun, and support each other.  Don't try to go it alone.</li>
